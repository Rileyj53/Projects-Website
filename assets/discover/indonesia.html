        Coffee was first brought to the country by Dutch traders in the late 1600s. They smuggled the seeds from
        Yemen and brought them to Indonesia. Indonesia saw coffee plantations spread quickly and by the early
        1700s commercial production was underway. Indonesia quickly because Europeâ€™s preferred source for coffee
        beans. In the mid-1800s a disease knows as Coffee rust affected the crops destroying plantations on the
        region. To save the industry the Dutch planted different disease-resistant coffee species, robusta.
        Unfortunately, the farms were plagued by poverty, starvation, and inhumane working conditions. By 1942
        the Dutch were forced from Indonesia and that significantly improved working conditions. When the Dutch
        left the government gave the plantations to the laborers giving them an opportunity to grow the
        industry. <a href="../Resources.html"><sup>11</sup></a>
