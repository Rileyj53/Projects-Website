        Coffee was brought to the region in the early 1700s and early coffee production was mostly consumed
        locally. Around the mid 1800s a disease devastated the coffee industries of Asia, Brazil and South
        America the chance it needed to really thrive as coffee exporters. By the 1910s Brazil was producing 80%
        of the world coffee. In the 90s coffee was deregulated by the government allowing farmers to find their
        own buyers and sell how they wanted. This opened the gates for Brazil to become the work leader in
        coffee innovation. Today Brazil doesnâ€™t produce nearly as large of a share of the worlds coffee, sitting
        at about 30% but they are still the largest producer in the world. Not only is Brazil the number one
        producer but they are also the number one consumer of coffee in the world, passing the United states in
        2010. <a href="../Resources.html"><sup>10</sup></a>
