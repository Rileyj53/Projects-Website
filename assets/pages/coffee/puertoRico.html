        Coffee was first introduced to the region under Spanish colonial rule. When it was introduced it wasn’t
        considered a very important crop. In the 19th century population and hurricanes had a negative impact on
        coffee production. By 1950 coffee production couldn’t keep up with the demand on the island let alone
        exports. Today Puerto Rican coffee farmers focus more on high quality small batch specialty coffee as
        opposed to mass production for exports.<a href="Resources.html"><sup>3</sup></a> This gives Puerto Rican
        coffee a very unique place in the world
        of coffee. Puerto Rican coffee traditionally has a balanced body and acidity, with a fruity aroma. This
        makes Puerto Rican coffee a rare sight to see, especially because they only produce about 17% of the
        coffee produced worldwide.<a href="Resources.html"><sup>4</sup></a>
