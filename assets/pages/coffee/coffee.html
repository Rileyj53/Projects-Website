    <p id="aboutUsP">This website is all about coffee and not just the sugar filled stuff you get from the store down
        the street either. This website will tell you about the history of coffee, where it originated and
        how it has developed and evolved over the years. I decided to make this website because ever since I was well,
        too young I’ve had a fascination with coffee. From roasting my own to now having worked for multiple coffee
        companies I have experienced almost every part of the coffee making process. A huge part of this website is the
        Around the World section. This section highlights the history of coffee in different countries along with some
        recipes you can try at home. Speaking of recipes, the recipe section has a selection of unique coffee recipes
        anyone can enjoy, whether you have a Keurig or a fancy espresso machine there’s recipes for you! The discover
        section is where the fun really begins. In the discover section you will either be transported back in history
        to learn some fun interesting facts about coffee, or you will be taken to a random recipe. Feel free to explore!
        This website was developed for IFT 301 by Riley Jacobson
