  <h1>The History of Coffee</h1>
  <h2>The beginning of coffee</h2>
  <p>
    While there are many legends about the origin of coffee, No one knows
    exactly how or when coffee was first discovered. One Ethiopian legend says
    that a goat herder named Kaldi first discovered the potential of these
    beloved beans. The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he
    noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats
    became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. When he
    reported this to the monks they made a drink with the berries and found
    that it kept them alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The
    monks shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and
    knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread. 1 As the world moved
    east, they brought coffee with them. This lead to the next major place in
    coffee history, the Arabian Peninsula.

  <h2>The industrialization of coffee</h2>

  <p>
    European travelers brought back stories of an unusual dark black beverage.
    By the 17th century, coffee had made its way to Europe and was becoming
    popular across the country. Coffee quickly began to replace the common
    breakfast drink beverages of the time, beer and wine. Those who drank
    coffee in the morning instead of alcohol began the day alert and
    energized, and not surprisingly, the quality of their work was greatly
    improved. <a href="Resources.html"><sup>12</sup></a> <br /><br />

    Coffee came to Europe in the 17th century, it was brought there by
    European travelers. They brought back stories of an unusual dark black
    beverage. Coffee quickly began to replace the common breakfast drink
    beverages of the time, beer and wine. Those who drank coffee in the
    morning instead of alcohol began the day alert and energized. Coffee began
    to become very popular across Europe, by the mid 17th century there were
    over 300 coffee houses in London.
    <a href="Resources.html"><sup>12</sup></a> <br /><br />

    As Europe began to explore west, they brought coffee with them. In the
    late 1600s coffee was brought to New Amsterdam, later to called New York
    by the British. Although coffee houses began to appear in the ‘new world’
    tea was still the most popular drink, which caused the Boston Tea Party.
    The Boston Tea Party and the taxes imposed by George III caused coffee to
    become the most popular drink in the “new world” by the late 17s and early
    18th century. <a href="Resources.html"><sup>12</sup></a> <br /><br />

    This worldwide popularity there was a growing economic demand for more,
    and better coffee. The Dutch were the first to try and commercially
    produce coffee, first starting in India with no luck and then again in
    Indonesia with great success. Once they had successful production, they
    began to spread to other islands, Mexico and brazil.

  <h2>Coffee In the World Today</h2>

  <p>
    Today coffee is still enjoyed everyday by billions of people. It is
    estimated that the average person spends between $1-$2k a year just on
    coffee.<a href="Resources.html"><sup>13</sup></a> From my personal
    experience working at a coffee shop some people spend upwards of $15 a
    day, just on coffee. Coffee has such a prevalent part in our daily lives
    that some even be willing to consider it an addiction. Coffee is enjoyed
    in many different cultures and communities around the world. On the Around
    the world page you can learn about coffee culture in different countries
    around the world. The Discover page will take you to a random page
