                In Mexico coffee is an essential part of the culture. sobremesa is a time after a meal where people
                usually socialize and relax with coffee. Traditionally the coffee is served with tequila and other
                liqueur for the adults and spiced coffee like a cortados for the younger generation.<a

                states they don’t add as much sugar but add more spices compared to the north. Coffee was first
                introduced to the region in the 1700s as Mexico was colonized by Spain.<a

                Coffee was first introduced to the region under Spanish colonial rule. When it was introduced it wasn’t
                considered a very important crop. In the 19th century population and hurricanes had a negative impact on
                coffee production. By 1950 coffee production couldn’t keep up with the demand on the island let alone
                exports. Today Puerto Rican coffee farmers focus more on high quality small batch specialty coffee as
                opposed to mass production for exports.<a href="Resources.html"><sup>3</sup></a> This gives Puerto Rican
                coffee a very unique place in the world

                makes Puerto Rican coffee a rare sight to see, especially because they only produce about 17% of the

                Coffee was first introduced to Costa Rica in the late 1700s when plants were gifted to anyone willing to
                grow them. The country has very mineral-rich volcanic soils and cool mountain climates these are the
                ideal conditions for growing coffee. Once Costa Rica had gained independence from Spain coffee exports
                helped fun lots of infrastructure in the country. But coffee also played a huge role in the culture as
                well everyone drank coffee from the farmer to the politician. The country only produces Arabica beans

                Beginning in the late 1700s Colombia quickly became a major exporter of coffee on the global scale. In
                1977 the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia was created to protect the interests of
                coffee growers, implementing a logistics system that enabled rural, small-estate farmers to export their
                coffee more efficiently. Since Colombia’s climate and elevation varies a lot the flavor of the coffee
                also varies with it. Lower and higher altitude coffee has a full body and deeper floral notes. While
                middle elevation tends to be well-rounded with nutty and chocolate flavors, a gentle sweetness, and a
                mellow acidity. Locals enjoy coffee much more than the rest of the world, they enjoy it at night not
                emphasizing the caffeine. This means coffee shops are open later and some aren’t even open in the
                mornings. <a href="Resources.html"><sup>8</sup></a>

                Some legends data coffee back to around 850 AD where a goat herder discovered the berries after his
                goats at them and became energized. Commercial cultivation didn’t begin until the 1500s and it started
                off small. By the 1800s commercial production was in full swing. One thing that makes Ethiopia unique is
                the natural coffee forests. This helped the coffee industry stay strong through multiple wars in
                Ethiopia. Ethiopian locals like to enjoy coffee from their region with Ethiopia only exporting 50% of
                the nations coffee. Ethiopian coffee has a very diverse taste because of how many different plant
                varieties there are. But despite that the regions coffee tends to have a more berry taste than others
                which means it is also more sweet. <a href="Resources.html"><sup>9</sup></a>

                Coffee was brought to the region in the early 1700s and early coffee production was mostly consumed
                locally. Around the mid 1800s a disease devastated the coffee industries of Asia, Brazil and South
                America the chance it needed to really thrive as coffee exporters. By the 1910s Brazil was producing 80%
                of the world coffee. In the 90s coffee was deregulated by the government allowing farmers to find their
                own buyers and sell how they wanted. This opened the gates for Brazil to become the work leader in
                coffee innovation. Today Brazil doesn’t produce nearly as large of a share of the worlds coffee, sitting
                at about 30% but they are still the largest producer in the world. Not only is Brazil the number one
                producer but they are also the number one consumer of coffee in the world, passing the United states in
                2010. <a href="Resources.html"><sup>10</sup></a>

                Coffee was first brought to the country by Dutch traders in the late 1600s. They smuggled the seeds from
                Yemen and brought them to Indonesia. Indonesia saw coffee plantations spread quickly and by the early
                1700s commercial production was underway. Indonesia quickly because Europe’s preferred source for coffee
                beans. In the mid-1800s a disease knows as Coffee rust affected the crops destroying plantations on the
                region. To save the industry the Dutch planted different disease-resistant coffee species, robusta.
                Unfortunately, the farms were plagued by poverty, starvation, and inhumane working conditions. By 1942
                the Dutch were forced from Indonesia and that significantly improved working conditions. When the Dutch
                left the government gave the plantations to the laborers giving them an opportunity to grow the
                industry. <a href="Resources.html"><sup>11</sup></a>
